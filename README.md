# NewspaperOutline by Vladislav Firstenko
I have added two html files, which you can see in this repository.
One of them was built on tables structure, another - on CSS styles structure ( there was a problem with HTML5 outlines and default HTML tables, so I rebuilt a code to css columns ).
The MAIN file is "newspaper_outline.html"!
Thanks for your attention!
